                        I'm a mostly self-taught web developer with a passion for creating things (from useful apps to games and fictional worlds).<br>In any role I take on, I seek to improve three things:<br>
                        1. My knowledge and abilities<br>
                        2. Existing workflows<br>
                        3. Communication and relationships between colleagues
